What needs to go in the main space of the page is some type of animation that shows off cool figures and bits of my code from my site. Not sure how to do this, but this would look really awesome. For mobile users we just have the nice simple landing page w/o the animation.

Where I'm at 2/19/2025

I got to the point where I can convert .ipynb's to .qmd and the preview the .qmds as 
Webpages. Now my task is to somehow combine the notebooks. I'm worried that If I combine
Them into a single .qmd, that I'll run into the same issue as when I had 1 gigantic note
Book: the models run out of memory and go all crazy. So, I think what I'll do tomorrow is
Try to make an easy to navigate project site. I'm not sure how to lay this all out though.

I also need to convert the BARS.md into a .ipynb to come up with some visualizations, and
Then convert that to a .qmd to publish. This is the first priority, since it's an easy win!

Workflow:

1. Open Jupyter Lab to code whatever project you want to display
2. Make sure to save any images that you want to use: you'll need to input these 
Manually into the .qmd file later to ensure you can make them responsive [Maybe?]
3. Convert the the .ipynb file to a .qmd with appropriate YAML header in a RAW
Module.
4. When in the same directory in the shell  do "quarto render [filename] --execute --self-contained"
