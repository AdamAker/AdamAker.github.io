What needs to go in the main space of the page is some type of animation that shows off cool figures and bits of my code from my site. Not sure how to do this, but this would look really awesome. For mobile users we just have the nice simple landing page w/o the animation.

Workflow:

1. Open Jupyter Lab to code whatever project you want to display
2. Make sure to save any images that you want to use: you'll need to input these 
Manually into the .qmd file later to ensure you can make them responsive [Maybe?]
3. Convert the the .ipynb file to a .qmd with appropriate YAML header in a RAW
Module.
4. When in the same directory in the shell  do "quarto render [filename] --execute --self-contained"

Todo:
1. Add in [3] and [4] to BARS navigation pages.
2. Figure out how to make code generated figures responsive.
3. Add CV link as a link on the front page.

Project Idea: get data on thunderstorms and build a Classifications on thunderstorms that produce tornadoes.
