# Professional Experience
## Research Assistant | University of Texas at Dallas (2019 - Current)
	- Developed a novel feature selection method BARS in Julia, and combined it with current feature selection methods to build  simpler and more accurate predictive models using machine learning techniques including (in both Julia and Python): decision trees, neural networks, and random forests. 
	- Increased model accuracy by 20%, as measured by the RMSE, and improved data-driven decision-making by reducing the number of required model variables from 329 to 5. This reduction decreased the number of necessary sensors from 9 to 5 for future experiments, significantly lowering future experimental costs.
	- Completed literature reviews, increasing research efficiency by utilizing LLMs such as ChatGPT and Gemini to streamline the search for relevant literature and systematically synthesizing key findings.
	- Conducted marine surveys to collect chemical concentration measurements.
	- Assembled low-cost sensor packages by soldering components, 3D printing cases, and updating firmware using C++ when necessary.
	- Tested portable mass spectrometers for leaks, adjusted electrical wiring, and updated technical documents with standard operating procedures and diagrams for the lab.
	- Published scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, demonstrating research impact by contributing to advancements in Data-driven feature selection methods for scientific modeling.
## AI Content Generation & Quality Control Specialist Contract (Nov 2024 - Jan 2025)
	- Curated datasets by developing challenging physics problems designed to stump the model, leveraging prompt engineering techniques to craft precise and structured queries that produce consistent model outputs across many different trials.
	- Performed multiple levels of review and quality control of curated cases by ensuring strict adherence to grammar and instructional guidelines to isolate model errors related to conceptual comprehension rather than question clarity.
## Teaching Assistant | University of Texas at Dallas (2019 - 2024)
	-	Led lab-based physics courses through interactive demonstrations, increasing the average student comprehension rate by 30%, as measured by pre- and post-diagnostic course exams.
	-	Developed grading rubrics to assess student performance on assignments and exams, and graded assignments and exams while tracking student progress using an organized record-keeping system.
	-	Provided individualized instruction, leading to an average improvement of one letter grade in student performance by adapting teaching strategies to various learning styles.
	-	Maintained student performance tracking, streamlining data management by implementing an efficient record-keeping system.
## Private STEM Tutor | Self-Employed (2012-Present)
	-	Specialized in one-on-one instruction in STEM subjects (from the high school AP level through to the upper undergraduate level), achieving an average of a letter grade improvement in students' courses by developing and adapting lesson plans based on student needs.
	-	Delivered ACT and SAT prep lessons, improving student confidence and average scores by 15-20% as measured by test scores through strategic test-taking approaches.
	-	Helped students overcome emotional barriers to learning by demonstrating empathy and compassion.
	-	Integrated digital learning tools, utilizing Skype and Google Meet for screen sharing, Desmos and Wolfram Alpha for visualizations, and iPads and Wacom boards for collaborative problem solving, enhancing student engagement through interactive simulations and virtual labs.

# Projects
	-	Binary Analytical Relational Score (BARS) addresses the limitation of correlation and mutual information by leveraging decision trees to detect functional relationships within data. Using BARS allows the user to produce simpler, more accurate, and more interpretable predictive models. [Paper in progress]
